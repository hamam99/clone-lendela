              Through Lendela, we are bringing more than a decade worth of
              experience on how to make loan comparison easier, faster and more
              transparent for both consumers and partners.

              With our well developed model and technology, we have already
              processed millions of loan applications in Scandinavia, Latin
              America and Southeast Asia throughout the years.

              Since Lendelaâ€™s launch in early 2018, we have aimed to merge
              Nordic-inspired user experience and financial technology with
              local expertise in this region. After starting in Singapore, we
              have also expanded our operations to Hong Kong.

              It is no secret that getting a loan can be difficult - and knowing
              if you got the best deal is impossible.

              {<br />}Based on our experience in loan comparison, we have
              identified the following issues for borrowers like you:
              <ol className="gap-4 leading-7" type="1">
                <li>1. You are not finding the cheapest loan possible</li>
                <li>2. You do not know how to go about applying for a loan</li>
                <li>
                  3. The application process is too complicated and troublesome
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Banks and financial institutions are not transparent with
                  you on application outcome and loan terms
                </li>
                <li>5. You cannot find a party that will approve your loan</li>
                <li>
                  6. After seeking help from a loan broker, you get many
                  unsolicited calls all trying to sell you a loan
                </li>
                <li>
                  7. Loan scams are prevalent and hard to distinguish from
                  legitimate ones
                </li>
              </ol>
              Lendela wants to solve all of those issues for you - all with just
              one application on lendela.com.
